# AI-Daily-Planner
AI Daily Planner is a simple yet effective web-based application designed to help users plan their day efficiently. With a clean user interface and instant interactivity, this tool allows users to input their daily goals and automatically generates a time-based schedule starting from 8:00 AM, assigning each goal a 2-hour slot.

This planner is ideal for students, professionals, or anyone looking to improve their daily productivity. It eliminates the need for complex planning tools by providing a lightweight and fast way to structure the day.

# How It Works:
The user enters their goals in a multi-line textarea, with each goal on a separate line.

On clicking the "Generate Schedule" button, the application processes the input and dynamically creates a schedule.

Each goal is assigned a time slot in 2-hour intervals, starting from 8:00 AM (e.g., 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM...).

The generated schedule is displayed in a neatly styled list for easy readability.
